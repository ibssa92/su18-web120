    <h3>About Essam</h3>
 <p> Essam Muhammad (better known as MasseOne) is from South Seattle, WA, USA of Moroccan descent. He harmonizes Rhythm And Poetry into his art which brings a unique and contemporary aspect into the Islamic realm of creativity. He comes from a community where the youth all share something in common, which is experiencing trauma from a young age. The arts became an outlet of expression to escape from the internalized oppression he has faced.‚Äù </p>
