 <p> My name is Ibssa Wado. I was born and raised in the mean streets of Bridgeport,CT. My father is from Oromia and my mother is half Somali and half Eritrean, so often times I just tell people I’m East African to keep things short and simple. I am also Muslim. I moved from Bridgeport to Seattle,WA in 2005. I have 2 siblings; an older brother and a younger brother. A few of my hobbies include playing basketball, football, watching sports, travelling the world, and spending quality time with family and friends. I am also somewhat of a Sneakerhead.</p>

 <p>I completed my bachelor’s degree in Media and Communication Studies from the University of Washington (Bothell) in June 2015. After graduating, I took some time off to relax and travel a bit. I started working at Amazon in 2017 as a Seller Support Associate. After a year of that, I decided it would be in my best interest to return to school and build some tech skills. I am currently pursuing a Programming Certificate at Seattle Central College, where I am studying Web and Database Development.</p>
